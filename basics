day1 : python list & boolean
boolean & their in built functions like isalpha(),isalnum(), isupper() also boolean & logic operators etc...
list & type, append, insert, indexing, extend, operations like sum(),, avg() , pop(),count(), lst.index()

day2: sets,dictionary & tuples
set -> {}, no duplicates, inbuilt funtions -> no indexing is possible in sets, set.add(), set.intersection(), set1.difference(set2) etc
dictionary -> set of key value pair {:,:,}, in dict we use indexing with key value for loop to iterator over dict for x in my_dict: for loop over value for x in my_dict.values():,
loop over both key & value for x in my_dict.items(): , nested dictionary
Tuples -> elements are not changable & replaced, tuple.count(element), tuple.index(element)

Numpy -> np.array(my_ist), aray.shape, arr.reshape(row,col), arr.indexing, arr[0:2,0:2] picks 4 values in oth & 1st row  & 2 cols, np.arange(start, end, step=), np.linspace(1,10,50) to create decimal values
np.random.rand, np.random.randn, np.random.randint,np.random.rand_sample
